# Assignment_2

This project almost made me want to throw my computer. The hardest part of the assignment was to 
prevent memory leaks and segmentation faults.
My code is very messy because I could not figure out how to make a method that can take an object of all three derived classes
from the Base class as a parameter. So, I had to copy and paste a lot of my code for each board. Other then that, everything works. 
The project was pretty fun to be honest, except for all the memory leaks.
